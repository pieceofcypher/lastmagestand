<p><b>Story of the world</b></p>

<p>There was a Golden Sphere world, conus-shape world setting inside the golden sphere, which protected him from emptiness of cosmos. Two Golden Pikes on edges of conuses were giving him a light and a warm. 
Thre was a water ocean on a equator with transparent water with golden color of light of sphere's walls and Pikes light. There weren't day or night, winter or summer, there were endless day and endless summer 
into the soft light of Two golden Pikes.</p>

<img src="worldStory01.png">

<p>And there was a life into the ocean. Warmed with heat of Pikes on a shallow water the first bacterias were born and soon the first plants were growth at the bottom. Between them the first primitive animals 
were lived and the first fishes were swim.</p>

<p>Time is passing and first plans made their steps on a land outside of water and the first insects start climb on them to eat them or hide from underwater preys. But then preys chase them here too and 
evolution fill the land as it filled the water earlier.</p>

<p>blah blah blah little note about evolution</p>

<p>One step more the first intelligent creatures were sitting on a grass and talking about nature of Golden Pikes and their magic power. There were a reptiles with long body painted with protective color and 
short legs, they relied on a tail and has 5 fingers on every hand. They were eating insects and plants mostly, but they were hunters as well and created flexible language to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>They created a whole civilization on both sides of conuses, but there are no stories about how they were lived there, all lore about that times were lost with ages. Probably they were peacefull nations or 
may be they had a many wars, we cannot know that. Their civilization was based on a magic, not iron and stones, they were no need metals and stones to create cities and find a food. There were endless hot 
summer and endless light day.</p>

<p>There was very hard to see stars on a sphere because of Golden Pikes light, but if you was brave and can reach ocean on his peak, in the point most far from pikes you can see some dim stars on the sky. But 
one day a very bright star became visible on the sky. Lizardmen can see it from any place of one semi-sphere. With an ages that star become brighter and brighter. One day it start shine brighter then Pike, but
 it keep growind and another day it grew up to the incredible big shining disk. THe first name it was given that disk where "The Brightest Star" and it keep his name even it turning into the disk. There was 
a time of magic. Magic fill the world, everyone was a mage. Lizardmen were no need houses to live, they didn't grow food, they just create it from nowhere, some of them didn't eat at all living in magic instead. They 
created wonder civilization of wisdom and were learning a universe. Many magical thing were created at that time and peaople has incredible long life.</p>

<p>Golden Pikes were protecting the world as the Golden Sphere and all life was safe inside of it, but one day, in time when The Brightest Star was turned into big disk, Golden Pike, which protected that part 
of semi-sphere, could not stand the load anymore and start melting. Literaly he died. Magic of the Star was much stronger than magic of the Pike and it was broken. He start melting and sink into the land. He 
stop warm a world, but light of The Brightest Star was so hot, so it warm the world instead. It even was hotter than Pike's warm and there became a very hot in the world, one Pike was dead and he can't protect 
the world anymore. Habbitant had to do something with it.</p>

<img src="worldStory02.png">

<p>Some of them decided to hide into ocean. A temperature of the ocean didn't rise alot so they can live there. The world still was full of magic and living under water wasn't hard. They just create gills 
for themself and keep enjoy their lives. Another ones hide on another part of world, where wasn't The Brigthest Star on a sky and the pike was alive (there was a time when "water-lizardman" race was created)</p>

<p>One day The Brightes Star stop became bigger and his size freeze for a some hundred years, but then it start to decrease. There was another cosmic body flying close to the Golden Sphere world and his time 
to fly away became. With an ages it bacame smaller and smaller, but it left his legasy into the world. The Melting Pike keep melting and sink into the land plungung deeper and deeper. There was a great crater 
with golden pure magic into it. It was very dangerous place and lizardmen avoid was there. Whole pieces of a land were broked off it and start flying into the air. And on a next step, when The Brightest Star 
became a star again, not disc, the land start shaking. Melted pike was going deeper and deeper inside of a land and start dissolve there.</p>

<p>In that times world cool down a little bit and some lizardmen decide to settle on that flying islands to avoid death of worldquake. When they did it they saw many little stars on the sky their race never 
saw before. The shine of The Brigtest Star, his magic create a billions tiny holes in the sphere and destroy his golden covering also there wasn't pike's light and nothing to hide the stars from signt. That 
was how drakonian race was created (they wasn't named "draconian" at that time, of course). The first ages they were using magic to fly, but with the times, when the world start lose his own magic over holes 
into the burned sky they created wings for themself using their magic mastery and learned how to fly.</p>

<p>The land start changing his shape. It began to became flat on a side with destroyed pike. There wasn't that great mount anymore, it was turned into great hill and land start flow to world edges.</p>

<img src="worldStory03.png">

</p>There was a hard times for lizardmen race. The world lost some magic and it became hard to do it. Some of them start create houses, another trying tame animals to have more food. Worldquakes was going often 
with a time and tsunami was striking a shore. There was a time of first great nation who settle side lighted by Golden Pike and expelled another lizardmen to bad lands. Actually, that lands was very fertile and 
full of different lifes, but no for race user to use magic over milleniums. Farther The Britest Star was flying away more hurt lizardmen have.</p>

<p>The world was disbalanced. Only one Pike was alive and it can't hold whole land alone, one day it cracked and separated away! Firstly there were fissures and one day the great shock happen. Pike fell off 
the land and soared up into the sky! It reach spheres limits and try break out but sphere is very strong thing and there is no easy leave it, so the pike start flying around the world! (actuslly sphere's 
limits are not solid or hard, it mostly like event horizont). That accident also mixed flying island on a other side of the world and some of them flew over with their habbitans to opposite side. </p>

<p>Now both side of the world lost their Golden Pikes and the land start flattened faster. Worldquakes became the usual thing, lisardmen don't care about it as it did it before. Many new things came into 
the world such like a day and a night. At places, when ocean touch the sphere limits water start freeze, the first ice come into the world. World's color has changed as well. On side which was burned by 
The Brightest Star was lighter than on a other side because many tiny holes passed more light are coming from flying Golden Pike, the sky there was turned from gold into white. Side that remain whole was 
turned from golden color into red (imagine an endless dusk). Further, in time, color keep changing. Pike try to leave dead world and it keep move away and sky colors become darker. White sky turned into a blue, 
red sky turned into violet specter. One day, when sphere limits can't hold the Pike at orbit it fly away and sky will turn into black and the world will cool down alot and many lifes will die and only that 
lifes who will hide in underground caverns warmed by dissolved magic of the Melted Pike stay alive. Time by time they will be coming out on a outer side of their shelter and looking on a tiny bright dots 
covered all over the sky - the stars which cool light will be reflected by iced land. But now nobody know it, the world still full of lifes fighting for their right live under the sun.</p>

<p>There will be many events befor the final day of the worth will come.</p>

<p>In times when the second Golden Pikes was broken out all lifes in the world was changed. So many things has changed. Day and night will appear, magic was flow out from the world and it was hard to do spells, 
the land continue to flatten instantly was quaking, all civilizations was destroed, even underwater and skyisland's civilizations. Live underwater became harder because there wast so many light as it was 
before and cool water from the frozed edges cooled down many space, the only spaces suitable for life were close to shore where landings was fishing and poor ocean resources wasn't enough for both races. 
There wasn't enough light in the sky as well. The brightes star flew away but light of remain Golden Pike was cyclic. Coold winds was roam the sky and turned sky island full of trees into naked rocks. So 
many of drakonians have to come down and start fight with habbitans of the land for all the same poor resources of shocked lifeforms of the land.</p>

<p>While three lizardmen races was trying to survive the land continued to flatten and one day it reach sphere limits, it abut and start lift up on the edge continue to flatten in center. The land mass 
separate one sphere into two semi-spheres! Every of them got his own ocean, some flying island, his own part of an animals and  plants and intelligent races. It became imposible go over from one side of the 
world to another. And with time the land became a really flat! Now there was two worlds instead of one!</p>

<p>That flat world stop quake so ofted, but it bring another trouble. Because the land became flat the ocean covered it. Literally, the world was sinking! One land massive on a both sides separated to many 
big and smalls island surrounded by water. Sea-lizardmen don't care about this "end of the world", they were happen even because all the world was going belong to them. Drakonians tried colonize flying island 
once again and reach succes on a violet side of the world (there is more magic remain on that side and this helped them). Drakonians of the blue side could colonize some only some island, but live there was 
very hard and when the land stop sink they try to return back. The land's mass is not really solid, it mostly like vescous substance warmed by magic of The Melted Pike. It keep flowing back and forth and this 
movement create many waves, which looks for us as mountain ranges. And because of that movement many caverns were created inside the land mass and it lift up the land a little bit. The world stop sinking, it 
swelled up even and some big mainlands were formed on a both sides. The end of the world for all airbreathinh life was stoped. The world became looks like we can see it now.</p>

<img src="worldStory04.png">

<p>In time when the land  only was coming to the edge of the world, but the ocean reach it and freeze to the ice new turn of evolution has started. There were warm-blooded creatures who always was living in 
the world. When temperature cool down reptiles cannot live in some place, but that warm-blooded creatures could, so they colonize all artic regions and all tundra shores. There was many fishes in water and 
no rivalry from cool-blooder reptiles, so they were living there for ages, mileniums while former great race of lizardmen were trying to survive in the changed world. Most earlier intelligent warm-blooded 
creature famous as Yotuns (acctually they were proto-yotuns, because those youtuns as we know them now a slightly differtent as it was in those times. There was two race created rom those proto-youtuns). 
They was big, ten feets tall, covered with long fur, which protected them from cold. They were hunters and scavengers and live in tundras. They knew how to create simple boats and they sail to the ocean for 
fishing.</p>

<p>Those big fured hunters were movind deeper on the continent with every age and they reached warm regions when they met lizarmen race. There was very hot for them, so only short-fured individuals can leave 
there. They start interact with lizardmen in war way mostly, bacause they were strange for cool-blooded unfured reptiles. Lizardmen noticed yotuns are inteligent and they start use them as a slaves. But there 
was very hard to rule slaves who bugger than you in some feet and much bolder. Lizardmen killed many of them and keep alive only those who were short-haired and send them into inner regions to block 
interaction with their relatives. Time by time slaves rebeled and run to the ocean in tundra when they mix with they race and more and more short-haired individuals were born. Also they brought new knowledge 
and crafts and soon naked yotuns with bows spears and shieldm which created simple wears and armor, who knew hot to grow plants and build houses invade into lizadmen's lands and push them away from there. Even 
magic couldn't help them, especcially yotuns were using it as well. This is happen on burned side of Golden Sphere because there was much cooler than on another side where magic wasn't lost and there wasn't 
tundras until the second pike broke down, so youtuns couldn't migrate deep into the land. Also the land was most populated with the lizardmen, they were much stromger there and it block evolution of any 
warm-blooden intelligent creatures.</p>

<p>There was a cult among yotuns of a burned side: naked individuals are better then short-haired, but fured individuals are not people at all. Most bravest warriors were naked and used wear when wether was 
cold, opposite to it they can move longer and deeper in the lizardmen's lands and bring more loot from there. So with the ages new race was created - Titans.</p>

<p>Titans are tall and bold creatures, they are very hardy and looks like humans (but this humans looks like titans, of course), they are brave and furious in battle and worship power and honor. They conquest 
many lands from lizardmen. But when the second pike was broken down they have to survive as well. So acctually there is no really great diffirense for the force of nature are you ten feet tall of six and how 
are you bold. Only if you were made from stone you could feel comfort in those times.</p>

<p>Youtun's evolution on the unburned side was going in another way. As this was said before youtuns as biological specie were in another situation there. Lizardman were dominated there and there wasn't 
tundras when they can live, so they migrated in a warm places but by small groups. Lizardmen hunted them as a rival for poor resources and they cannot live in vilages or do craft. They were hiding in deserted 
places when did scavenge. Probably better say they did now evolved, but degraded. When the second pike was broken down and land start move change faster lizardmen on violet side have to survive and big and 
strong youtuns finnaly move to the center of the land when they can find more food. They wasn't social creatures yet and they forget how to craft items, but they were much bolder than iceland yotuns, with 
short hairs. They keep live in deserted and unpopulated places and prefere night for scavenge. It was pretty hard for them to hunt at inner lands because there wasn't big creatures they can hunt, so they 
mostly steal prey from pack of predators or where sitting immovable for hours waiting a moment to strike. They find caverns in the land and start explore in. They found many strange lifes there and start to 
hunt it, their form and size allow them to do it easy, they was new predators there. Hairs finnaly left they bodies. In times, when the world stabilized lizardmen kill many of them on a surface, but at 
mountains, at a thiket, at the underground and another places when intelligent races avoid to live they feel good. This is how troll race was created. They moved the underground over and came out on a blue 
side, but that side was occupated yet and they couldn't move further than mountains. So they now inhabbit mountains, hills mostly on a both side the world, and the underground.</p>

<p>The second pike crash brough dark times for everyone. World changed a lot and everyone have to survive. Magic became poor and lizardmen lost their power, they started do so many new things like animal 
husbundry and plowing. But they were very old and educated race, it helps them to create new civilizations. The melted Pike keep dissolved in the land, but it still was in realy big pieces and some times it 
came out on a surfaces as a springs. Lizardmen were concentrated at these places and they were created metropolices around it with big strong walls. Other lands were captured by titans. Titans created their 
own countries. Those two races were in wars often, but there was and peace between them. With a time every metropolice live by his own way and every titans tribe were did the same. So some of them were in war, 
some if them in peace. When generations changed their attitudes changed as well. In these times titand learned magic from lizardmens and with ages they became mightier and mightier while one day during one war 
titan's army could conquest lizarmen's megalopolice. Physycal power of titans with their magic knowlege made them very strong rival for lizardmen race and in the next two hundred years another megalopolice 
fell. Titans start dominate on a burned side of the world.</p>

<p>Drakonian and dragons</p>

<p>Firstly flying island were created on a burned side when The melted Pike was drowning into the land. Big pieces of the land were cracked out of it and start fly in the air. With time some of them reached 
anothe side of sphere and stayed there. To avoid worldquakes lizardmen colonize them on a both side. These were rocky mostly. there wasn't good places of plants to grow on that high under constant cold wind, 
but magic of lizardmens were saving them all until they can di magic well. With time magic started leave the world and lizardmen of both side create wings for themself. It was still good time for that race. 
Drakoniand were flying between island all around the world and to went down on the land to trade with their former race. Most powerfull mages keep changing themself. They were knew magic is leaving the world 
and they were searching the way too keep it. THey gathered it and keep it inside their body. They became big and people called them dragons. After the second pike broke down live on flying island became very 
hard. There was too cold and windy and nature there was too poor to create food. And dragons turned against their own nation and expelled drakoninds from many islands. Futher dragons fell in sleep to keep 
saving their magic power and do not wasting it for useless war and control of rocky pieces of flying lands.</p>

<p>After exile drakonids of burned side were living on a surface but they cannot bear rivalry against lizardmen of megalopolices and titans' countries. Cold-blooded, they had very short range of places when 
they could live and dissapear with time. 

<p>Drakonids of unburned side felt much better. Magic which saved on that side helps them to survive, espescialy there wasn't titans. THeir keep their civilization alive and feel good.</p>

<p>Elves, gnomes and men</p>

<p>During mastering the magic and wars against lizardmen specific society was created in titand race. There was most educated of them who were learned new knowlege alot. They stop worship bravery and power and 
concentrated on a learning. After first megaloppolice fell they found endless amounts of scrolls full of knowlede and start many schools to study it. Those wars against magic race demand from titan's mages 
dedicate all their life to magic and teach and new generation to spell a magic. During that wars most strong and bold individuals prefere fighting as warrions but slim and short individuals were studing the 
magic and to that time when lizardmen's civilization on a blue side was finally destroyed and their remains where pushed away into barren lands that new race was created. They was named elves. Elves were 
lower than titans and not so bold and strong. They prefer live in distand places, mostly in the woods or mountain's valley when loud and restless relatives can't disturb them.</p>

<p>After lizardmen of blue side were destroyed some tribes of titans decide to invade on another side of the world to conquest it as well. Elves declined to come with them as another tribes did as 
well. There was a rivalry amont titans nation already because they destroyed all opponents and captured all the land and disputes who is better and most powerfull has started. Those tribes formed and alliance 
and came into the underworld. Titans never were there and when they were coming through they found many wonders they neves seen before. The way was hard but they overcame all obstacles and came out on a violet 
side. Titans were stuned by colors of that side and power of magic there. Lizardmen was much stronger than their relatives of blue side and fighting against them them was very hard. Opposite of it titans found 
spell magic is very easy there. so even they never was a mages they can do it with no efforts. Some of them keep their way of honor and power and choose the way resist the magic. Another part choose the way 
study a magic. The first big war has started on the violet side.</p>

<p>Lisardmen of the violet side lived in another way as their race of the blue side. They did not orginize megalopolices, but create many little countries or independed cities, there wasn't big alliances or 
kingdoms. Titant conqusted them one by one but lizardmen were fighting very good. Those war changed titans. Most tall of them and bold were easy targets for spells and died very fast, berserker's rush wasn't 
succesfull because enemy could cast spell to break it down, so in some centuries titans became race of dwarfs mostly than giants. Also they holds for underground when they were working for precious items and 
weapons. Many of them prefer do the magic. They inhabbit deep violet forests and with ages became race of gnomes. Titans couldn't conquest violet side, but these side change them. More time go more they forget 
their roots, live there was pretty different from live on a blue side. Dwarves were turned into people who live in mountains or underground, they are bold, but short, with good magic resist, they love 
underground treasures and digging the land to find them. Gnomes is like analog of elves of the blue side. They both love live in deep forest and mountain valays, they are good with magic. But gnomes never was 
really study it as knowlege, because they never need did it, magic is pretty easy for spell for them. In they lonely live if deep forest they degrade a little bit and prefer live with small tribe and never 
pretend for conquests. Dwarf found they desteny in the mountains and in the underworld. With time they came back to the blue world and started trade with those people who inhabbit those land, but with many 
ages passed it was another nation, not titans' kingdoms.</p>

<p>Orks</p>

<p>When titans won the war agains lisardmen of blue side they exile their remains into barren lands. Live there was very hard, but lisardmen survive... with a big price. They evolve into something different. 
Rivalry between them lefts only strong, bold and agressive individuals. Disjointed lizardmen dergrade very fast, they forget who they was before and forget high mastery of magic. They increase with high and 
boldness. Many ages of live at barren lands turned them into orcs.</p>

<p>Humans</p>

<p>In time when lisardmen were evoluting into stronger creatures, relaxed titans lost all they great enemies and start degrade. Ages of luxury make them weak. They forget their ways of power and honor and 
worship meanness and sneakyness now. They became shorter and lost boldness, they were turned into humans.</p>

 </p>


<p><b>Spidermen</b></p>

<p>Nobody know when these creature were created. Probably this happen when The Melted Pike was drowning into the land. Probably some of explorers of melting pike were accidentaly captured in a trap and 
dissolve in a liquid magic and later their genes were merged with genes of spiders. Magic of The Melting Pike create many strange creature in time when it was dissolve in the land. They looks very strange: 
abdomen of a spider, but body is a reptilelike, head with no hair is round with a big mouth full of sharp teeth, eight eyes all around the head make imposible to made sudden attack. It has six legs and two 
hands and there are fingers with sharp nails on it. They have a sting and can weave a web. They are pure black with no any painting. And they are big like a horse, but it make them imposible to climb on 
a walls. They run very fast on a short distance. They live underground only, no one has ever seen them on a surface.  </p>

<p><b>Fungusmen</b></p>

<p>There is not only spidermen are strange intelligent creature live underground. There is another race named fungusmen. They looks like big mushroom with a brown cap and white pale stalk. They have 
eight tentacles at bottom which they use to move, eat and as a hands. They have no any viscera, no heart, no stomach or nerves, there are many fibers of different structures and many functions with it which 
replace all internals. Four tentacles has suckers they use to move and to eat. It wrap around his food and suck all liquids from it. Fungusmen have no lungs, they breath with their jills, but they need 
air to move over it, so they can't be in places with no air. As intelligent creatures they use some tools to mix an air when they are in a place with no winds. They live in colonies only and create walls 
from cutted stones to protect it from preys. They don't forge metals, but they are good with the stonecraft, they use a sling to throw stones on a distance. Nobody know how they see. They have some luminous 
spots on a cap, so probably they need a light, but where are their eyes?</p>
